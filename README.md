## Haskalkulator
### A symbolic calculator complete with Lexer, Parser, and Evaluator written in Haskell

Most of this code comes from this [very nice tutorial](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/bartosz/basics-of-haskell/).

Writing a small "language" to understand Monads and parsing in Haskell.

To run install stack, fork/clone the repo, and run
```bash
stack build
stack exec haskalkulator
```
